# PenGUIn: A GUI-based Ubuntu hardening script for organizational security policies
Contributed to a team project for SIH 2023 Hackathon, developing a user-friendly Linux app with a GUI for simplified OS hardening. The application offers essential, advanced, and add-on security options, allowing users to easily customize measures such as blocking SSH, TOR, and USB ports. With streamlined one-click USB and Tor exit node blocking, the app enhances user experience. It features two modes, Essential and Advanced, catering to minimal or comprehensive hardening, along with additional tweaks like cache cleaning and update checking for heightened system security.
