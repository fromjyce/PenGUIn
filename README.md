# PenGUIn - GUI-Based OS Hardening Script

Welcome to PenGUIn, a flexible GUI-based hardening script designed for Ubuntu to align with organizational security policies. PenGUIn simplifies the process of OS hardening with a user-friendly Linux application that provides essential, advanced, and additional security tweaks, making it easier for users to ensure their systems comply with security requirements.

## Overview

PenGUIn offers a comprehensive solution for OS hardening with a graphical interface, allowing users to perform various security tasks efficiently. Hereâ€™s an overview of what can be achieved with PenGUIn:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides a graphical user interface for managing security configurations, eliminating the need to type complex scripts.
- **Security Measures**: Key security measures include blocking SSH, TOR exit nodes, and USB ports, ensuring comprehensive system protection.
- **Customizable Options**: The application features essential, advanced, and additional options for diverse security needs, with a modular design for user-selected options.
- **One-Click Features**: Streamlined functionalities such as one-click USB blocking, cache cleaning, and temporary file deletion for ease of use.
